title: "Writing Functions (Niko)"
teaching: 10
exercises: 15
questions:
- "How can I create my own functions?"
objectives:
- "Explain and identify the difference between function definition and function call."
- "Write a function that takes a small, fixed number of arguments and produces a single result."
- "Correctly identify local and global variable use in a function."
- "Correctly identify portions of source code that will be displayed as online help, and in particular distinguish docstrings from comments."
- "Write short docstrings for functions."
keypoints:
- "Break programs down into functions to make them easier to understand."
- "Define a function using `def` with a name, parameters, and a block of code."
- "Defining a function does not run it."
- "Arguments in call are matched to parameters in definition."
- "Functions may return a result to their caller using `return`."

## Break programs down into functions to make them easier to understand.

*   Human beings can only keep a few items in working memory at a time.
*   Understand larger/more complicated ideas by understanding and combining pieces.
    *   Components in a machine.
    *   Lemmas when proving theorems.
*   Functions serve the same purpose in programs.
    *   *Encapsulate* complexity so that we can treat it as a single "thing".
*   Also enables *re-use*.
    *   Write one time, use many times.

## Define a function using `def` with a name, parameters, and a block of code.

*   Begin the definition of a new function with `def`.
*   Followed by the name of the function.
    *   Must obey the same rules as variable names.
*   Then *parameters* in parentheses.
    *   Empty parentheses if the function doesn't take any inputs.
    *   We will discuss this in detail in a moment.
*   Then a colon.
*   Then an indented block of code.

def print_greeting():
    print('Hello!')
~~~
{: .python}

## Defining a function does not run it.

*   Defining a function does not run it.
    *   Like assigning a value to a variable.
*   Must call the function to execute the code it contains.

~~~
print_greeting()
~~~
{: .python}
~~~
Hello!
~~~
{: .output}

## Arguments in call are matched to parameters in definition.

*   Functions are most useful when they can operate on different data.
*   Specify *parameters* when defining a function.
    *   These become variables when the function is executed.
    *   Are assigned the arguments in the call (i.e., the values passed to the function).

~~~
def print_date(year, month, day):
    joined = str(year) + '/' + str(month) + '/' + str(day)
    print(joined)

print_date(1871, 3, 19)
~~~
{: .python}
~~~
1871/3/19
~~~
{: .output}

*   Via [Twitter](https://twitter.com/minisciencegirl/status/693486088963272705):
    `()` contains the ingredients for the function
    while the body contains the recipe.

## Functions may return a result to their caller using `return`.

*   Use `return ...` to give a value back to the caller.
*   May occur anywhere in the function.
*   But functions are easier to understand if `return` occurs:
    *   At the start to handle special cases.
    *   At the very end, with a final result.

~~~
def average(values):
    if len(values) == 0:
        return None
    return sum(values) / len(values)
~~~
{: .python}

~~~
a = average([1, 3, 4])
print('average of actual values:', a)
~~~
{: .python}
~~~
2.6666666666666665
~~~
{: .output}

~~~
print('average of empty list:', average([]))
~~~
{: .python}
~~~
None
~~~
{: .output}

*   Remember: [every function returns something]({{ site.github.url }}/04-built-in/).
*   A function that doesn't explicitly `return` a value automatically returns `None`.
