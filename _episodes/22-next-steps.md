## Python supports a large community within and outwith research.

*   The [Python 3 documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/) covers the core language
    and the standard library.

*   [SciPy](scipy.org) is a rich collection of scientific utilities.

*   [Jupyter](jupyter.org) is the home of the Jupyter Notebook.

*   [Pandas](pandas.pydata.org) is the home of the Pandas data library.

*   Stack Overflow's [general Python section](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/python)
    can be helpful,
    as can the sections on [NumPy](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/numpy),
    [SciPy](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/scipy),
    [Pandas](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/pandas),
    and other topics.

*   [PyCon](pycon.org/) is the largest annual conference for the Python community.
